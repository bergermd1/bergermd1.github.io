      'Poverty is deeply entrenched in Afghanistan. This can be attributed in part to the country’s physical isolation, rugged terrain and often harsh climate; to underlying cultural norms, especially with regard to the rights of women; and to its recurring history of conflict, insecurity and outside interference.  Afghanistan’s poverty profile is further shaped by marked disparities between rural and urban areas, sustained population growth, extremely low levels of female participation in the work force, and the overwhelming prevalence of vulnerable forms of employment in informal and low-productivity jobs.  Afghanistan remains one of the most dangerous and most violent, crisis-ridden countries in the world. There is persistent deepening and geographic spread of conflict. There are also regular violations of International Law and Human Rights. CARE first established its mission in Afghanistan in 1961, but suspended activities after the Russian invasion of 1979. Resuming activities in 1989 from a new base in Peshawar, Pakistan, CARE delivered assistance to Afghanistan from across the border until 2002 when it shifted its main office back to Kabul.  CARE Afghanistan has developed three programs: Women’s & girls’ empowerment Enhanced resilience Humanitarian action ',

The paste is stripped of excess oil with water and made into the desired shape (round balls, cylinders, etc.). Adding potash to the oil increases the boiling point of the oil. This results in oils being extracted from the kuli-kuli so that more liquid oil is created than when the process started. While being heated and fried, the shaped peanut-paste begins to solidify and harden. It is then removed from the oil and allowed to cool down until ready to be eaten.',

For example, CARE works with children, young people and women in the formal education sector and outside of it, supporting rural schools to offer vocational training, and helping some of Brazil’s poorest communities develop sustainable businesses and access microfinance. Home to a large percentage of the world’s remaining forests, the 20 million Brazilians living in extreme poverty are likely to be among the worst affected by climate change. CARE therefore worked with state governments to develop policies that link climate change mitigation with combating poverty. We also worked with communities to establish sustainable forest management systems and reforest areas on land reform settlements, while helping state governments measure the quality and impact of new initiatives aimed at reducing deforestation.',

      'With prolonged political insecurity, high levels of poverty and significant human rights concerns, the humanitarian situation in Burundi remains fragile. Natural disasters, population movements, malaria epidemics and the risk of Ebola crossing into the country compound an already precarious situation. Despite increasing returns of Burundian refugees from Tanzania, close to 326,000 people still remain refugees in neighboring countries including Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. With a quarter (24%) of returnees without land following repatriation, more than 106,000 people are displaced inside Burundi; many returnees have been displaced again due to severe weather conditions, including floods and droughts, and the socio-political situation. Women and girls suffer the most. Not only do they bear additional financial and domestic responsibilities to look after their families, but many also endure daily violence and insecurity. Some resort to paid sex to support themselves and their children. CARE International in Burundi has developed a Women’s Empowerment Program focused in rural areas, but with a nationwide advocacy platform focused on women’s rights, and hosts youth programs to improve Sexual and Reproductive Health and to reinforce economic empowerment and gender equality.  In 2019, CARE provided emergency packages that are specially tailored to the needs of women and girls. CARE helps vulnerable women with small savings groups to start up small businesses. At the same time, CARE works with communities to provide information about balanced nutrition and how to prepare food safely in order to prevent malnutrition. CARE established an office in Burundi in March 1994 to help people affected by civil strife following the assassination of Burundi’s first elected President in October 1993. CARE-Burundi’s initial program focused on the distribution of non-food items to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returning Burundian refugees in five northern provinces. After civil war erupted in Rwanda in April 1994, CARE increased its assistance to help the enormous influx of Rwandans fleeing into northern Burundi. ',

Soto, especially soto ayam (chicken soto), is an Indonesian equivalent of chicken soup. Because it is always served warm with a tender texture, it is considered an Indonesian comfort food.",

In the wake of a series of shocks in the late 1990s, we redirected our focus towards emergency programming.  When the 2004 tsunami hit, we were one of the first international aid agencies to respond, providing people with desperately needed food, water and shelter.

The broth is based on tuna species found in the nation's ocean waters such as skipjack, yellowfin tuna, little tunny, or frigate tuna. In order to cook garudiya, tuna fish are cut up following a traditional pattern. After having had the gills and some of the innards thrown away, the fish pieces, the heads and the bones are carefully washed. The fish is then boiled in water with salt, until it is well cooked. Garudiya is usually eaten with steamed rice, but it can also be eaten with roshi, the Maldivian chapati. When eaten with steamed taro, or with steamed breadfruit, grated coconut is added.",

      'CARE began working in Mali in 1975 to help the government respond to an emergency. Our focus widened to programs where local communities take the initiative in their own development. In all our work, we defend the rights of the most vulnerable and marginalized people to obtain basic services, particularly women. We help women and children improve their lives through access to credit, opportunities to earn a living and access to quality education. We work with farmers and fishers to enable them to better use natural resources. We work to eliminate female genital mutilation, child labor and trafficking. We continue to respond to emergency situations when these arise and helped the government and other agencies halt the spread of Ebola in the country.

Some 100 million CARE packages reached people in need during the next two decades, first in Europe and later in Asia and other parts of the developing world.In 1946, the then-Prime Minister of Norway, Einar Gerhardsen, signed an agreement to receive CARE Packages.

CARE places a special emphasis on strengthening women’s access to and awareness of their sexual and reproductive health rights and HIV and AIDS prevention within communities, increasing the availability of quality information and sexual and reproductive health services, taking into account the different gender needs and sensitivities, while in parallel working with stakeholders and communities to strengthen mechanisms that will improve sexual and reproductive health services and facilities to adolescent girls and vulnerable women. CARE’s sexual and reproductive health program is present in about 30 percent of the communities in Sierra Leone, prioritizing implementation in districts with a high HIV burden and high rates of teenage pregnancy.CARE also works to build upon the investments made under the Post-Ebola Recovery of Health Services (PERHS) program in order to sustain the facility, its systems, equipment and community in specific districts and works to enhance women’s economic empowerment through skills development.',

Žganci was consumed as a substitute for bread, while the leftovers used to be toasted with lard the following day, so that no food went to waste. Today, the dish can be found throughout the country, but it is prepared differently in each region of Slovenia. It is commonly served with sauerkraut and grilled sausages on the side.

Water is added to the starch during mashing, and again just before eating, to achieve the desired consistency, which can range from highly viscous to liquid. In Hawaii, this is classified as either "one-finger", "two-finger", or "three-finger", alluding to how many fingers are required to scoop it up (the thicker the poi, the fewer fingers required to scoop a sufficient mouthful).',

      'Turkey hosts the highest number of refugees globally, reporting over 3.6 million registered Syrian refugees. Turkey has been able to cope with hosting refugees better than Syria’s other neighboring countries, but refugee issues are increasingly politicized, creating significant protection risks.

Syrians struggle to meet basic needs and often turn to harmful coping mechanisms when all other options run out.CARE prioritizes assistance for people with specific needs: women, youth, and people with disabilities. As the economic burden and length of displacement increase, many refugees turn to early marriage, child labor, and informal and unsafe employment. These practices, coupled with the lack of livelihoods and coping mechanisms perpetuate risk, particularly for women and girls. Language barriers and a lack of reliable information on and access to rights and assistance means that Syrian refugees face ever-present protection, abuse, and exploitation risks.Since 2014, CARE has focused on protection, basic needs, and economic empowerment for refugees, especially women and girls. CARE has developed working relationships with government authorities for operating permits and cooperates with municipalities at the local level. As of December 2020, more than 600,000 refugees and members of the host community have received lifesaving assistance in the following ways:239,557 refugees received greater access to critical information on legal and other forms of protection and rights, and services through outreach and community support structures.211,508 refugees received monthly, one-off and/or time-bound assistance to meet urgent needs.120,785 refugees worked with CARE’s shelter team to secure and upgrade dwellings.19,210 refugees became more self-reliant through improved access to essential basic services and reduced reliance on negative coping mechanisms through the provision of individualized protection support.6,522 refugees, especially women, have became more economically self-reliant through multiple CARE services that foster growing micro-enterprises including loans, developing personal agency, and life skills.',

Neighboring countries are seeing huge refugee influxes, largely women and children, with lines at the borders stretching for miles. More than 4.2 million people have left Ukraine in search of safety, and that number is expected to climb. The U.N. is estimating 18 million people will be affected by the conflict, including 7.1 million who are likely to be internally displaced.Even prior to the invasion, years of conflict in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine had left 2.9 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and displaced 1.5 million people from their homes. For Ukrainian refugees and internally displaced people, the most immediate needs include food, clean water, shelter and protection from violence, including gender-based violence. In addition to the ongoing conflict, other major challenges for displaced families include the freezing weather, COVID-19 concerns, and access to healthcare, especially for women and the elderly.Women and girls are particularly at-risk during times of conflict and displacement, most notably due to the increased risk of violence, exploitation, discrimination, and poor access to vital health services.',

      'CARE International is a global confederation of 16 member organizations – Austria, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States – working together to end poverty.Founded in America in 1945 after World War II, CARE was first known as the “Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe.” CARE first sent food aid and basic supplies in the form of CARE Packages to war-torn Europe – where millions were in danger of starvation and these goods were either heavily rationed or impossible to find. Some 100 million CARE packages reached people in need during the next two decades, first in Europe and later in Asia and other parts of the developing world.Britain received its last CARE packages in 1955. By then, CARE was working in 18 countries across the globe. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the economies of the former wartime nations developed and improved and the focus of CARE’s work shifted from Europe to the problems of the developing world.Initially CARE continued to focus on food aid, but in the 1960s we expanded our remit – pioneering primary health care programs. In the 1970s, we responded to massive famines in Africa with both emergency relief and long-term agro-forestry projects, integrating environmentally-sound tree- and land-management practices with farming programs.',
