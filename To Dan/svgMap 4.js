    'Poverty is deeply entrenched in Afghanistan. This can be attributed in part to the country’s physical isolation, rugged terrain and often harsh climate; to underlying cultural norms, especially with regard to the rights of women; and to its recurring history of conflict, insecurity and outside interference.  Afghanistan’s poverty profile is further shaped by marked disparities between rural and urban areas, sustained population growth, extremely low levels of female participation in the work force, and the overwhelming prevalence of vulnerable forms of employment in informal and low-productivity jobs.  Afghanistan remains one of the most dangerous and most violent, crisis-ridden countries in the world. There is persistent deepening and geographic spread of conflict. There are also regular violations of International Law and Human Rights. CARE first established its mission in Afghanistan in 1961, but suspended activities after the Russian invasion of 1979. Resuming activities in 1989 from a new base in Peshawar, Pakistan, CARE delivered assistance to Afghanistan from across the border until 2002 when it shifted its main office back to Kabul.  CARE Afghanistan has developed three programs: Women’s & girls’ empowerment Enhanced resilience Humanitarian action ',

With a quarter (24%) of returnees without land following repatriation, more than 106,000 people are displaced inside Burundi; many returnees have been displaced again due to severe weather conditions, including floods and droughts, and the socio-political situation. Women and girls suffer the most. Not only do they bear additional financial and domestic responsibilities to look after their families, but many also endure daily violence and insecurity. Some resort to paid sex to support themselves and their children.

In 2019, CARE provided emergency packages that are specially tailored to the needs of women and girls. CARE helps vulnerable women with small savings groups to start up small businesses. At the same time, CARE works with communities to provide information about balanced nutrition and how to prepare food safely in order to prevent malnutrition. CARE established an office in Burundi in March 1994 to help people affected by civil strife following the assassination of Burundi’s first elected President in October 1993. CARE-Burundi’s initial program focused on the distribution of non-food items to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returning Burundian refugees in five northern provinces.

CARE and People in Need have been prioritizing those hardest hit—the old, the young, pregnant mothers, those with disabilities and those without access to any other support.CARE worked in Cambodia between 1973 and 1975, distributing food, providing medical assistance and improving education. From 1975 onwards CARE worked to support the millions of Cambodian refugees who fled the Khmer Rouge and were living in camps along the Thai-Cambodian border.In 1990, we returned to Cambodia, working with the United Nations to help 370,000 Cambodian refugees return to their homes. Over the years, CARE has shifted its focus in Cambodia from short-term, vital relief operations, to long-term projects in health, education and rural development.',

This new strategy draws from CARE’s previous innovations and builds on them – emphasizing in particular CARE’s expanded role as a facilitator and development partner with Mozambican colleagues from civil society who are likewise dedicated to transformative, rights-based development in collaboration with the private sector and government.In March and April 2019, Southern Africa was hit by two subsequent cyclones that left a trail of destruction in their path, and close to 2.2 million people in need of urgent assistance in Mozambique alone. CARE immediately mounted a response that continues today, reaching hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans with household and shelter kits, hygiene kits, water and sanitation programming, food assistance, and programming to prevent gender-based violence and protection.',

Traditionally, mămăligă is cooked by boiling water, salt and cornmeal in a special-shaped cast iron pot called ceaun or tuci. When cooked peasant-style and used as a bread substitute, mămăligă is supposed to be much thicker than the regular Italian polenta to the point that it can be cut in slices, like bread. When cooked for other purposes, mămăligă can be much softer, sometimes almost to the consistency of porridge. Because mămăligă sticks to metal surfaces, a piece of sewing thread is used to cut it into slices instead of a knife; it can then be eaten by holding it with the hand, just like bread.',

    'Turkey hosts the highest number of refugees globally, reporting over 3.6 million registered Syrian refugees. Turkey has been able to cope with hosting refugees better than Syria’s other neighboring countries, but refugee issues are increasingly politicized, creating significant protection risks. Social services are overstretched, and anti-migrant sentiments are on the rise, often erupting in clashes. Syrians struggle to meet basic needs and often turn to harmful coping mechanisms when all other options run out.CARE prioritizes assistance for people with specific needs: women, youth, and people with disabilities. As the economic burden and length of displacement increase, many refugees turn to early marriage, child labor, and informal and unsafe employment. These practices, coupled with the lack of livelihoods and coping mechanisms perpetuate risk, particularly for women and girls. Language barriers and a lack of reliable information on and access to rights and assistance means that Syrian refugees face ever-present protection, abuse, and exploitation risks.Since 2014, CARE has focused on protection, basic needs, and economic empowerment for refugees, especially women and girls. CARE has developed working relationships with government authorities for operating permits and cooperates with municipalities at the local level. As of December 2020, more than 600,000 refugees and members of the host community have received lifesaving assistance in the following ways:239,557 refugees received greater access to critical information on legal and other forms of protection and rights, and services through outreach and community support structures.211,508 refugees received monthly, one-off and/or time-bound assistance to meet urgent needs.120,785 refugees worked with CARE’s shelter team to secure and upgrade dwellings.19,210 refugees became more self-reliant through improved access to essential basic services and reduced reliance on negative coping mechanisms through the provision of individualized protection support.6,522 refugees, especially women, have became more economically self-reliant through multiple CARE services that foster growing micro-enterprises including loans, developing personal agency, and life skills.',

Some 100 million CARE packages reached people in need during the next two decades, first in Europe and later in Asia and other parts of the developing world.Britain received its last CARE packages in 1955.

In the 1970s, we responded to massive famines in Africa with both emergency relief and long-term agro-forestry projects, integrating environmentally-sound tree- and land-management practices with farming programs.',

    'Dovi is a traditional peanut stew from Zimbabwe made with crushed peanuts, garlic, onions, okra, vegetables such as carrots or potatoes, and stock or other liquids. The dish can be made with or without meat, typically chicken, goat, or lamb. It is recommended to pair it with sadza (cornmeal and water), rice, or mashed potatoes on the side. Ugali, or sima, is a type of stiff maize flour porridge made in Africa. It is also known as vuswa, bogobe, fufu, gauli, gima, isitshwala, kimnyet, kuon, mieliepap, ngima, nshima, obokima, ovuchima, (o)busuma, oshifima, oruhere, pap, phutu, posho, sadza, ubugali, and umutsima, among other names. Sima is sometimes made from other flours, such as millet or sorghum flour, and is sometimes mixed with cassava flour. It is cooked in boiling water or milk until it reaches a stiff or firm dough-like consistency.',
    'CARE began working in Zimbabwe in 1992 in response to severe regional drought and has since expanded programming to address longer-term development issues. Currently, an estimated 5.8 million people are facing severe food insecurity in Zimbabwe as a result of the human-made climate crisis.Investing in water infrastructure is critical for tackling the drought that is gripping large swaths of the country and the wider region. CARE is focused on providing easy access to water for drinking and irrigation to stop the spread of disease and to prevent people – most of whom are women and girls – from walking miles to and from water sources every single day.Through strategic local partnerships, CARE is implementing both short-term and long-term programming to empower Zimbabwe’s vulnerable households to meet their basic needs through sustainable livelihoods. To that end, CARE’s programming in Zimbabwe is focused on the following areas: food and nutrition security, climate resilient livelihoods, economic development, education, and water, sanitation, and hygiene.',
